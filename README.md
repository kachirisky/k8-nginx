Why K8 ?

The use of numbers in abbreviations is a common practice in the tech industry, particularly in the fields of software development and IT. The numbers represent the number of letters omitted from the original word. For example:

k8: Kubernetes
o11y: Observability
i18n: Internationalization
l10n: Localization
gRPC: Google Remote Procedure Call
d3.js: Data-Driven Documents JavaScript library
f2e: Front-end Development
b2b: Business-to-business
It's a way to shorten a long or technical word and make it easier to type and remember.
