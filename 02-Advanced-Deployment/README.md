Kubernetes Basic Objects

Kind:					apiVersion:
Pod     				v1
Deployment				apps/v1

POD: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/

Deployments: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/deployment/


1. Lets create a Basic POD and deploy this with multiple containers

2. Create a Deployment with a side car


Notice the difference in how a POD YAML and a Deployment YAML are different

* What about replicasets and what are they for?


* As as group fix the following deployment 03-Deployment-to-POD.yaml



* Optional Bunus: Deploy Fibunacci and break the cluster but first needs troubleshooting to start 04-Fibonacci.yaml
